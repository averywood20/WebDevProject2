                   <p>Welcome to <strong>Gather in Grace</strong>, a community-driven platform designed to help UNCC students find small religious groups on campus.
                    Whether you're looking for a Bible study, a prayer group, or a fellowship to grow in faith, Gather in Grace connects you with like-minded individuals who share your beliefs.

                    We believe that faith grows stronger in a supportive community. Our mission is to provide a **single place** where students can explore different religious organizations, learn about upcoming events, and discover the right group that feels like home.

                    No matter where you are in your spiritual journey, there is a place for you here. Take a look around, explore the different groups, and start your journey toward deeper faith and friendships today!</p>
